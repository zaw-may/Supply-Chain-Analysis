### Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing and optimizing supply chain management and performance using Python Pandas and other relevant libraries. I worked on improving supply chain efficiency and forecasting future trends. Then, I created visual insights to better understand the effectiveness of supply chain operations. This project includes data importing, data exploration, data cleaning, data visualization and data forecasting. Additionally, I trained a Random Forest Classifier to support better decision-makings by predicting whether a delivery will be late.
